# Mission to Mars

## Overview

### Background

Web Scraping with HTML/CSS: In this project, a web browser is automated to visit different websites to extract data about Mars. The data is stored in a NoSQL database, and rendered in a web application via Flask.

### Objectives

- Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to perform an automated web scrape
- Use a MongoDB database to store unstructured data from the web scrape
- Create a Flask web application to display the data
- Use Bootstrap to customize the app style

## Results

The web application functions as intended: pressing the "Scrape New Data" button at the top of the homepage triggers the web scraping Python script that collects the latest data about Mars from various webpages.
